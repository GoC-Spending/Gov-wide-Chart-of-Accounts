7.1 	Introduction

This chapter provides information on the object code classification and includes
in Section 7.2 	of this chapter the list of Object Codes as follows:
- Objects of Expenditure;
- Objects for Revenue; and
- Objects for Assets, Liabilities and Other Transactions.

The object classification is a field of the government-wide coding block that
identifies the type of goods or services acquired, the transfer payments made, the
source of revenue or the cause of increases or decreases in assets and liabilities.

The object information provides:
- A method for classifying and coding transactions to permit the reporting of
information about the nature of transactions in the Estimates and in the
Public Accounts;
- A standard classification of transactions for internal departmental analysis
and central management purposes; and
- The basis used by Statistics Canada to determine and report more accurately
the impact of government revenues and expenditures on the rest of the
economy.

In addition, the object coding provides a repository of government-wide
information, which can be used by central agencies without requiring departments
and agencies to respond to numerous individual requests.

7.1.1 	Object Classification Structure

To accommodate the need for various degrees of detail, other levels of object
classification are used. In descending order of aggregation after categories and
standard objects, there are reporting objects and economic, source and class
objects.

Categories (The first digit)

This is the highest level of object aggregation. There are mainly eleven categories
in the lists of Objects and are as follows:
- Objects of Expenditure comprise 4 	categories, which are Services, Goods,
Land, Buildings and Works, Transfer Payments and Other Expenditures.
- Objects for Revenue comprise 2 	categories, which are Tax Revenue and
Other Revenue. Tax Revenue consists of an object for Tax Revenues and
Other Revenue is identified such as Rights and Privileges, Leases, Sales of
Goods and Products, Services, Return on Investments and Miscellaneous
Other Revenue.
- Objects for assets, liabilities and other transactions comprise 5 	categories,
which are Assets, Liabilities, Other, Accumulated Deficit and Identification of
Partnering Department for Interdepartmental Settlement Transactions.

Standard objects are the highest level of object classification used for
parliamentary and management purposes, and are used to report information in
the Estimates and Public Accounts. They apply to expenditures only. (See Section
7.1.4 	for a brief explanation of each Standard Object as presented in the
Estimates). The allocation of the categories by standard object is as follows:

Category 0– Services includes the following Standard Objects:
01. Personnel;
02. Transportation and communications;
03. Information;
04. Professional and Special Services;
05. Rentals;
06. Repair and Maintenance.

Category 1– Goods, Land, Buildings and Works includes the following Standard
Objects:

07. Utilities, Materials and Supplies;
08. Acquisition of Land, Buildings, and Works;
09. Acquisition of Machinery and Equipment.

Category 2– Transfer payments include the following Standard Object:
10. Transfer Payments.

Category 3– Other expenditures include the following Standard Objects:
11. Public Debt Charges;
12. Other Subsidies and Payments.

Sub-categories (The first two digits)

Sub-categories are a primary breakdown of each category. In many cases, they are
the same as the standard objects.

Reporting objects (The first three digits)

Reporting objects are a sub-division of sub-categories, which are used for central
management purposes.

Economic, source and class objects (The four digits)

Economic, source and class objects are the lowest levels of object classification
used for government - wide reporting purposes. Economic objects apply to
expenditures only and measure the impact of government transactions on the
economy. The expenditures are classified according to the type of resources
(goods and services) acquired or the transfer payments made. Source objects
identify the origin of a receipt and apply to tax revenue and other revenue. Class
objects identify the causes of increases or decreases to financial claims or
obligations.
As most departments or agencies require more detail, transactions may be
classified by departmental line object in the departmental system. To permit the
consolidation and comparison of information from all departments, the line
objects must be aligned with the objects prescribed in Section 7.2.

7.1.2 	Maintenance of Object Codes

List of Objects
The object codes that are to be recorded for expenditures, revenue, assets,
liabilities, and other transactions are listed on the Government-wide Chart of
Accounts (GWCOA) Web site as section 7.2 	of this chapter. The list is updated
regularly to include all changes made to the object codes.

List of descriptions
Interpretation and analysis of financial information require the classification and
coding of transactions to be correctly and consistently applied.
To help departments and agencies improve accuracy and consistency in the coding
of their financial transactions, the descriptions are included in the detailed list of
object codes included in Section 7.2, of this chapter.
To maximize the use of the detailed descriptions, departments should review it
carefully to ensure that the alignment of their line objects is correct. Where
applicable, a copy of the relevant descriptions should also be made available to
departmental personnel involved in coding to help ensure consistent coding and
reporting, both within the department and within the government as a whole.

7.1.3 	Pay Entitlement Codes
A pay entitlement code classifies the type of remuneration paid to employees
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of
employment, or other arrangements. These codes are issued to departments and
agencies by Public Works and Government Services Canada (Compensation
Sector). The pay entitlement codes are listed with the lists of Objects to improve
consistency and accuracy in the alignment of pay entitlement codes to economic
objects mainly in standard object 01. The List of Pay Entitlement Codes is
included as Appendix C to Section 7.2 	of this chapter.
